### 21.2.1

 - new SQL tables: `led_events`, `led_algorithm_settings`
 - `dosing_algorithm_settings` has a new schema: a json blob to represent any editable settings.
 - new `pio` command: `pio run led_intensity`, ex: `pio run led_intensity --channel B intensity 50`
 - new `pio` command: `pio update` will update the software to the latest code on Github (later will be latest released version), and if possible, update the UI code as well.
 - new library dependency `DAC43608` that supports our LED driver.
 - config.ini now has abstracted any RaspberryPi pins: we only refer to the PCB labels now in config.ini
 - `pio kill` can accept multiple jobs, ex: `pio kill stirring od_reading`
