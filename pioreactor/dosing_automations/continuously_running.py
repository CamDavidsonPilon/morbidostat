    """
    Useful for using the Pioreactor as an inline sensor.

    Idea 1: I start add and remove in threads
        - only fires dosing_events once
        - UI dosing doesn't update well

        - this failed because the threads weren't exiting properly (since there was a sleep in them)

    Idea 2: in `execute` have a while loop that flips between add and remove
        - don't need threads
        - not very spammy

        this failed because the timer thread wasn't exiting properly (since it was a while loop)

    âœ… Idea 3: set duration very small, and fire small dosing events
        - follows closest to existing dosing automation patterns.
